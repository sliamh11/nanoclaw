# Benchmark Comparison

How Deus compares to other open-source AI assistant frameworks. Last updated: April 2026.

## Philosophy

Different tools solve different problems. **OpenClaw** optimizes for breadth: 10+ channels, 5,700+ community skills, any LLM provider. **Hermes Agent** optimizes for autonomy: self-creating skills, 15+ channels, and the widest LLM provider list. **Deus** optimizes for depth: semantic memory that actually recalls last week's conversation, a judge-based self-improvement loop that tunes its own prompts, and per-conversation container isolation that's on by default — not opt-in.

Choose the right tool for what you care about.

## Deep Dives

### Agent Isolation

Most frameworks treat sandboxing as optional. Deus makes it the default architecture — every conversation group gets its own Linux container with:

- **Non-root execution** (uid 1000, no privilege escalation)
- **Read-only source mounts** (agent can't modify the host codebase)
- **Credential proxy** (real API keys never enter the container — a host-side proxy injects them at the HTTP level)
- **Mount allowlist** (stored outside the project directory, tamper-proof from inside the container)
- **Per-group session isolation** (groups can't see each other's conversation history)

OpenClaw runs agents in the host process by default and offers Docker as an opt-in. NemoClaw adds kernel-level sandboxing (Landlock, seccomp) which is stronger at the syscall level, but doesn't isolate per-conversation — it's one sandbox for the whole agent.

### Memory Architecture

| System | Storage | Search | Cross-session recall |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **Deus** | SQLite + sqlite-vec (768-dim vectors) + atomic facts | Semantic search with recency boost + hierarchical tree walk with see_also hops | Yes — 3-tier: warm (recent by date), cold (semantic search), tree (hierarchical retrieval) |
| **OpenClaw** | Markdown files on disk | Keyword / filename | Session-based persistence, no semantic search |
| **NemoClaw** | Via OpenClaw | Via OpenClaw | Via OpenClaw |
| **Hermes Agent** | SQLite + FTS5 | Full-text search + preference profiling | Yes — 3-layer: session context, FTS5, automated user profiling |
| **Plain Claude** | Context window | None | No (each conversation is isolated) |

Deus uses a three-tier retrieval strategy:
- **Warm tier**: Last N sessions by date. No API call, no embedding cost. Free.
- **Cold tier**: Semantic search over all indexed sessions. One Gemini embedding call. Results are re-ranked by recency so recent context surfaces higher.
- **Tree tier**: Hierarchical walk from a `MEMORY_TREE.md` root through topic branches, with `see_also` hops across branches. Uses local Ollama embeddings. Handles cold-start recall (finding the right note on the first turn) and cross-branch discovery (surfacing facts the flat embedding wouldn't rank highly). Returns `abstained:true` instead of guessing when confidence is low.

On top of retrieval, `memory_indexer.py --extract` breaks session logs into atomic facts with entity-relationship graphs and contradiction detection. This means the system knows that "the auth migration was decided on Monday" and "we rejected approach X because of Y" as discrete, searchable facts — not just chunks of conversation.

Asking "what did we discuss about the auth migration?" will find the relevant session even if it was weeks ago and used different terminology.

### Self-Improvement Loop

Hermes Agent auto-creates skills from experience, but its self-assessment "almost always thinks it did well" — there's no external judge. Deus uses an external judge to score responses honestly, then feeds low scores into a structured improvement pipeline:

```
Production interaction
        │
        ▼
   Judge scores it (0.0 – 1.0)
   ├── Ollama (local, free) for eval
   └── Gemini for production scoring
        │
        ▼
   Score < 0.6?
   ├── Yes → Reflexion: generate self-critique + corrected response
   │         Store for future pattern matching
   └── No  → Log and move on
        │
        ▼
   20+ scored samples accumulated?
   ├── Yes → DSPy optimizes the system prompt
   │         using scored interactions as training data
   └── No  → Wait for more data
```

The agent literally gets better at its job over time. Low-scoring responses generate reflections that improve future answers. Once enough data accumulates, DSPy tunes the system prompt itself.

### Eval Layer

Deus includes a [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) test suite that validates agent behavior before merges:

- **Core Q&A tests** — factual accuracy, reasoning
- **Tool use tests** — correct tool selection, parameter generation
- **Safety tests** — refusal of harmful requests, prompt injection resistance
- **Parallel pre-warm** — containers cached across test runs
- **Dynamic concurrency** — scales to available resources

Judge options: OllamaJudge (local, free, gemma4:e4b) or GeminiJudge (cloud).

No other framework in this comparison ships with a built-in eval suite for the agent's conversational behavior.

## Token Efficiency

> Deus adds ~920 tokens at session start compared to vanilla Claude Code. That buys persistent identity, semantic memory, and a self-improvement loop. The self-improvement loop itself adds zero tokens — it runs asynchronously.

### How Deus compares to vanilla Claude Code

On the default Claude path, Deus uses the same Claude Agent SDK and `claude_code` system prompt preset as vanilla Claude Code. The backend-neutral runtime keeps the surrounding Deus behavior stable while other adapters catch up to that baseline.

#### Tool filtering (Deus *saves* tokens here)

Vanilla Claude Code exposes all tools by default (~30+ tools). Deus explicitly enumerates `allowedTools`, restricting to only what each session needs:

| Scenario | Tool count | Est. tool tokens |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Vanilla Claude Code (no filter) | 30+ | ~3,000+ |
| Deus — personal assistant query | 24 | ~2,400 |
| Deus — coding / orchestration query | 27 | ~2,700 |

The **SWARM_SIGNALS optimization** excludes `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, and `SendMessage` from non-orchestration queries (no external project mounted, no swarm keywords in prompt). That's ~300 tokens saved on the majority of personal-assistant turns.

#### Context injection (what Deus adds)

| Source | Est. tokens | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Group `CLAUDE.md` (persona, rules, memory paths) | ~960 | Once per session (KV-cached) |
| Global `CLAUDE.md` (shared capabilities) | ~560 | Once per session, non-main groups only |
| Reflections block (past learnings) | 0–500 | Per-turn, only when semantic match found |

Skills (`/compress`, `/resume`, `/preserve`, etc.) are loaded on demand — zero per-turn cost unless a skill command is invoked.

#### Net overhead vs vanilla

```
Tool savings:     -600 T  (filtered 30+ → 24 tools)
Group CLAUDE.md:  +960 T
Global CLAUDE.md: +560 T  (non-main groups)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net per session:  +920 T  (one-time at session start, then KV-cached)
Per-turn (avg):   ~+40 T  (reflections, amortized — most turns hit zero)
```

#### What +920 tokens buys you

| Feature | What it is | Token cost |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Persistent identity | Per-group persona, name, tone, formatting rules (WhatsApp vs Telegram) | +960T session start |
| Semantic memory | Recalls past conversations via 768-dim vector search with recency boost | 0–500T per-turn, on hit only |
| Self-improvement loop | Judge → reflexion → DSPy prompt optimization | **0** — runs async, never in prompt |
| Container isolation | Per-group Linux container, credential proxy, mount allowlist | **0** — host-side infrastructure |
| Eval suite | DeepEval QA / tool-use / safety tests | **0** — CI only |
| Skills system | 6 built-in skills (`/compress`, `/resume`, etc.) | **0** — loaded on demand |

The self-improvement loop, eval suite, container isolation, and credential proxy add **zero tokens** to the agent context — they run asynchronously on the host or as a separate CI step.

## Scope

- Deus focuses on depth: memory, self-improvement, and security — not channel breadth or ecosystem size.
- Deus supports Claude (default) and OpenAI/Codex (opt-in). Arbitrary provider support is not a goal.
- Quantitative latency/throughput comparisons are not included because they depend on hardware, network, and API tier — not the framework.
