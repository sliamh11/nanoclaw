# ADR: Pattern Verification System

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-10
**Scope:** `scripts/drift_check.py`, `patterns/`, `.mex/ROUTER.md`, `docs/decisions/`

## What this is about (in plain English)

Deus has a folder full of **pattern files**. A pattern file is a short cheat-sheet that tells Claude what rules to follow for a certain type of task — like "deploying the service", "adding a channel", or "debugging a silent failure". These cheat-sheets replace loading huge source docs every time. They save a ton of tokens and make Claude much faster.

There's a catch: **the cheat-sheets were written by hand, so they could silently miss rules**. Nothing checked whether a cheat-sheet actually matched what the real documentation said. If someone added a new rule to the main docs and forgot to update the matching pattern, Claude would just follow the outdated cheat-sheet forever.

This ADR describes the automated system that catches missing rules before they cause problems.

## Why the old approach failed

When we audited the patterns manually, we found **8 real content gaps** — rules the docs required but the patterns didn't mention. Some were serious: one pattern was missing a rule that caused containers to always get SIGKILLed because two timers collided.

Looking at *why* those gaps existed, we found 6 root causes:

1. **Writing a summary once and never checking it again.** Easy to miss non-obvious rules.
2. **Important context split across multiple docs.** A writer distilling one doc can't see rules that live in a different doc.
3. **"Exceptions to the rule" not documented alongside the rule.** The pattern says "always X" but the ADR said "except when Y".
4. **Universal rules stranded in one pattern file.** Rules that apply to *every* task only lived in one specific pattern, so task-specific patterns never saw them.
5. **New architecture decisions written after the pattern was last reviewed.** The pattern never got re-checked.
6. **References to files that don't exist anymore.** Patterns quoted paths that had been renamed or deleted.

Each of these is a *category* of failure, not a one-off mistake. A robust solution has to catch categories, not instances.

## What we built

One existing script (`scripts/drift_check.py`) grew from a simple mtime checker into a 6-mode verification system. One new frontmatter field (`test_tasks:`) was added to every pattern. Zero new files for the core logic.

Each mode catches one of the failure categories:

| Mode | Catches which category | Speed | Runs in CI? |
|------|------------------------|-------|-------------|
| `--drift` *(existing)* | Source doc modified after pattern last updated | fast | yes |
| `--paths` *(new)* | Pattern references a file/dir that doesn't exist (category 6) | fast | yes |
| `--adr` *(new)* | A new ADR was written after the pattern's `last_verified:` date (category 5) | fast | yes |
| `--all` *(new)* | Aggregator that runs all the fast checks | fast | yes — this is what CI calls |
| `--validate` *(new)* | **Semantic content gaps** — rule exists in source docs but missing from pattern (categories 1–4) | slow (LLM) | weekly cron, skips without API key |
| `--validate-router` *(new)* | `.mex/ROUTER.md` routes a task to the wrong pattern | slow (LLM) | weekly cron, skips without API key |
| `--contradictions` *(new)* | Two patterns give directly conflicting advice | slow (LLM) | on-demand, skips without API key |

## Two insights that make this work

**Insight 1: Behavioral tests beat bookkeeping tests.** We briefly considered building a "rule inventory" system — tagging every rule in every source doc and tracking which pattern cites it. That's exactly the manual bookkeeping that caused the problem in the first place. Instead, `--validate` asks a deeper question: "given this pattern alone, does Claude produce a correct plan for this task?" If yes, the pattern content is complete *by definition*. No hand-maintained mappings.

**Insight 2: The source docs themselves are the ground truth.** The `--validate` auditor doesn't compare against a golden answer we wrote by hand. It compares the plan (from the planner LLM that only saw the pattern) against the *full* source documentation (which the auditor LLM can see). The source docs are already the canonical rulebook — we just didn't have an automated way to check patterns against them before.

## How each check works

### `--paths`
Walks every pattern file. For each pattern, reads the `governs:` frontmatter list AND extracts backtick-quoted paths from the body. Checks that every referenced file exists on disk. Takes ~10 ms.

### `--adr`
Reads `docs/decisions/*.md`. Each ADR declares a `**Date:**` and a `**Scope:**` (list of file paths the ADR affects). For each pattern, compares the pattern's `last_verified:` date against every ADR whose Scope overlaps the pattern's `governs:` list. If the pattern is older than an overlapping ADR, it's flagged for re-review. Takes ~20 ms.

### `--validate`
Two-LLM-call process per task:
1. **Planner call**: Sends only `patterns/{the-pattern}.md` + `.mex/ROUTER.md` + universal rules (from `general-code.md`) + a task description to Gemini. Asks: "list every rule you would follow for this task, based only on what you see above."
2. **Auditor call**: Sends the plan from step 1 + *all* source docs (CONTRIBUTING-AI.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, SECURITY.md, every ADR) + the original task to Gemini. Asks: "list every rule from the source docs that the plan missed for this specific task."

If the auditor finds nothing missing, output is `NO_GAPS`. Otherwise, each gap is listed with a citation. Takes ~30–60 seconds per pattern.

### `--validate-router`
One LLM call per task:
- Sends `.mex/ROUTER.md` + the list of valid pattern filenames + the task to Gemini.
- Asks: "which pattern file would you load for this task?"
- Compares the answer to the pattern the task was declared in.

Mismatch = either the router is confused or the test_task is too generic to disambiguate. Takes ~5–10 seconds per task.

### `--contradictions`
Single LLM call that concatenates all pattern bodies (separated by `--- filename ---`) and asks: "find rules that directly contradict each other across different patterns." The model responds `NO_CONTRADICTIONS` or lists each pair with file references. Not wired into `--all` (opt-in only — LLM-based). Takes ~5 seconds for the full set.

### Router precedence rule

`.mex/ROUTER.md` now has a `## Precedence` section that resolves routing ambiguity with a ranked-specificity principle:
1. Security-sensitive code → `security-review`
2. Subsystem-internal changes → the subsystem's own pattern
3. `general-code` is the fallback

This is a general principle, not a hardcoded list. Adding a new pattern doesn't require updating the precedence rule — it applies automatically.

## The `test_tasks:` frontmatter

Each pattern declares 3+ short task descriptions in its YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
test_tasks:
  - "Add a Discord channel with OAuth login"
  - "Add capabilities: logging to a new MCP channel server"
  - "Register a new MCP tool on the Telegram channel with a Zod input schema"
```

These serve as **golden inputs** for the LLM checks. There are no golden *answers* to maintain — the source docs provide the ground truth, and the LLM does the comparison. When someone adds a new pattern, they just add 3 example tasks. No test fixtures to keep in sync.

## How to add a new verification layer

The system is designed to grow. Adding a new check (say, "layer 7") is a repeatable 5-step pattern:

1. **Write a `check_X(project_root)` function** in `scripts/drift_check.py`. It takes the project root and returns an exit code: `0` = pass, `1` = real problem found, `2` = unrecoverable error.
2. **Wire it into argparse.** Add a new flag in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block and a dispatcher case.
3. **Wire it into `check_all`** if it's fast enough to run on every PR. Skip this step if it requires LLM calls or network — those stay opt-in.
4. **Add an npm script** in `package.json` so humans can run it by name (e.g. `npm run pattern-validate-router`).
5. **Write unit tests** in `scripts/tests/test_drift_check.py`. Use `monkeypatch.setattr(drift_check, "PROJECT_ROOT", tmp_path)` to sandbox the check against a minimal fake project tree. For LLM-based checks, test the skip paths (no API key, no target file, empty filter) — the full LLM flow is covered by periodic smoke tests.

Every existing check follows this shape. Grep for `def check_` to see them.

When to add a new layer: if a future audit finds that a new *category* of gap keeps slipping through (not just a specific bug), that category gets its own check. The 6 existing modes catch the 6 categories we found. We don't speculate about future categories.

## Known gaps

Being honest about what this system does *not* catch:

1. **Rules that live only in code** — ESLint configs, commit-msg hooks, test assertions. These are already enforced by CI, so the pattern system deliberately doesn't duplicate them. Mixing patterns (knowledge) with CI (enforcement) would bloat everything.
2. **Source doc staleness vs actual code behavior** — a doc could describe behavior the code no longer implements. This is a docs-validation problem, not a pattern-validation problem. Would need AST analysis or behavioral tests — out of scope.
3. **Semantic no-op source changes** — if a source doc is reorganized without changing its rules, `--drift` flags the pattern anyway. The workaround is trivial (bump `last_verified:`), so no fix.

Each of these is documented as a deferred task with an implementation plan in `docs/decisions/pattern-verification-deferred.md`.

## Consequences

- **Every PR gets fast pattern checks for free.** CI runs `--all` automatically.
- **Content gaps can be found on demand.** `npm run pattern-validate` surfaces rules missing from patterns vs source docs. Runs with Gemini, costs ~$0.25 for a full scan.
- **Router mistakes can be found on demand.** `npm run pattern-validate-router` surfaces cases where the router picks the wrong pattern.
- **Cross-pattern contradictions caught.** `npm run pattern-contradictions` flags rules that directly conflict across patterns.
- **New patterns plug in with minimal work.** Add a pattern, add 3+ test_tasks, everything else flows through automatically.
- **The system is explainable to anyone.** This ADR. Seven checks, one file. No complex abstractions.

## Reasons alternative approaches were rejected

- **Markdown anchors + bidirectional rule tracking.** Would require editing every source doc to tag every rule, and maintaining a rule inventory by hand. That's the manual process that caused the original problem.
- **Mirroring ESLint/lint rules into patterns.** CI already enforces these. Duplicating them would double the maintenance burden and confuse the architectural split between "knowledge" (patterns) and "enforcement" (CI).
- **Runtime behavioral tests that exercise patterns.** Interesting idea but would require building a task-dispatch harness. `--validate` achieves the same signal (does this pattern produce a correct plan?) without any new infrastructure — it just asks an LLM the question directly.

## Managing at scale

As the number of patterns, source docs, and ADRs grows, use this guide to stay on top of the verification system.

### Quick reference — all commands

| Command | What it does | When to run |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `npm run drift-check` | All fast checks (drift + paths + adr + test_tasks + coverage) | Every PR (CI does this automatically) |
| `npm run drift-check:mtime` | Just the mtime-based drift check | Quick local sanity check |
| `npm run drift-check:paths` | Verify all pattern-referenced paths exist | After renaming/deleting files |
| `npm run drift-check:adr` | Flag patterns stale vs recent ADRs | After writing a new ADR |
| `npm run drift-check:coverage` | Report docs/ files no pattern covers | After adding new docs |
| `npm run pattern-validate` | LLM content audit (slow, needs GEMINI_API_KEY) | After editing a pattern or source doc |
| `npm run pattern-validate-router` | LLM router correctness (slow) | After editing ROUTER.md or pattern test_tasks |
| `npm run pattern-contradictions` | LLM cross-pattern conflict detection (slow) | After adding a new pattern or changing rules |

### Adding a new pattern

1. Create `patterns/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter: `governs:`, `last_verified:`, `test_tasks:` (3+ entries)
2. Add a row to `patterns/INDEX.md`
3. Add a routing row to `.mex/ROUTER.md`
4. Run `npm run drift-check` — should pass with the new pattern included
5. Run `npm run pattern-validate -- <name>` — verify content completeness
6. Run `npm run pattern-validate-router -- <name>` — verify routing accuracy
7. Run `npm run pattern-contradictions` — verify no conflicts with existing patterns

### Updating an existing pattern

1. Edit the pattern content
2. Update `last_verified:` to today's date
3. Run `npm run pattern-validate -- <name>` to verify the edit didn't introduce gaps
4. If you changed `test_tasks:`, also run `npm run pattern-validate-router -- <name>`

### After writing a new ADR

1. Add `**Scope:**` to the ADR frontmatter (list of file paths the decision affects)
2. Add the ADR to `docs/decisions/INDEX.md`
3. Run `npm run drift-check:adr` — any pattern whose `last_verified:` predates the new ADR and overlaps its scope will be flagged for re-review

### Interpreting results

- **DRIFTED** (`--drift`): a governed source file was committed more recently than the pattern. Re-read the source and update the pattern, then bump `last_verified:`.
- **MISSING** (`--paths`): a path referenced in the pattern no longer exists. Remove or update the reference.
- **STALE** (`--adr`): a new ADR affects files this pattern covers. Re-read the ADR and incorporate any relevant rules, then bump `last_verified:`.
- **MISMATCH** (`--validate-router`): either the router text is ambiguous or the test_task is too generic. Tighten the test_task wording or adjust `ROUTER.md`'s precedence/routing table.
- **GAPS** (`--validate`): the auditor found rules in source docs that the pattern doesn't mention. Re-distill the missing rules into the pattern.
- **CONTRADICTION** (`--contradictions`): two patterns give opposite advice. Resolve by scoping the rule to its context or removing the conflict.

### Scaling characteristics

- **Fast checks (`--all`)**: O(patterns × ADRs) — milliseconds. CI runs on every PR. No degradation at 50+ patterns.
- **LLM checks**: O(patterns × test_tasks) API calls. Each call is independent and could be parallelized. Current cost at 8 patterns × 4 tasks = 32 calls ≈ $0.25 per full scan.
- **Pattern filter**: every LLM command accepts an optional pattern name to scope to a single file, so you don't need to scan everything every time.
