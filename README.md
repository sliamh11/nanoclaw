A personal AI that lives in your messaging apps, remembers your conversations, and learns from every interaction. Ask it something you talked about weeks ago - it remembers. Give it feedback - it actually changes. Everything runs on your computer. Your data stays yours.

---

## What it does

1. **Remembers everything** - Ask about something from three weeks ago. It recalls the details, even if you don't remember what you called it. (95% recall on the [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813) benchmark.)

2. **Learns from every interaction** - Scores its own responses, figures out what worked and what didn't, and gets better over time. The longer you use it, the sharper it gets.

3. **Picks up where you left off** - Context carries over between sessions. Start a project Monday, come back Thursday, and it knows where you left off.

4. **Lives where you already are** - WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail. Add only the ones you need. Your memory follows you across all of them.

5. **Private by default** - Runs on your machine in isolated containers. No cloud sync, no tracking, no data leaving your computer.

6. **Works on your code too** - Run `deus` in any project directory for a coding assistant that already knows your preferences and past work.

<details>
<summary>And more</summary>

- **Voice** - Send a voice message and it transcribes and responds. Runs locally on Apple Silicon.
- **Vision** - Send a photo or screenshot and it sees and responds to it.
- **Calendar** - Reads and manages your Google Calendar. Ask what's coming up, or tell it to book something.
- **Scheduled tasks** - Daily summaries, weekly recaps, reminders - set it and forget it.
- **Web & video** - Summarize YouTube videos, fetch web pages, or research a topic, all from a chat message.

## Quick Start

### What you need

- macOS (Apple Silicon recommended), Linux, or Windows
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed and authenticated
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (handles WSL 2 on Windows automatically)
- Node.js 20+, Python 3.11+
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (free tier is enough)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) for local AI models (memory and scoring) - `/setup` pulls the right models automatically based on your hardware

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sliamh11/Deus.git
cd Deus
claude            # or: codex
```

Then inside the CLI:

```
/setup
```

Setup installs dependencies, builds the container, and walks you through configuration. At the end it offers a **Personality Kickstarter** - choose a behavioral bundle (developer, student, universal) or pick individual behaviors, and optionally give it example conversations so it's useful from day one.

### Connect a channel

A fresh install has zero channels. Add only what you need:

```
/add-whatsapp           # Scan QR code to connect WhatsApp
/add-telegram           # Paste bot token to connect Telegram
```

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#commands-and-skills) for all available skills.

### Start talking

```
@Deus what's on my calendar tomorrow?
@Deus summarize the YouTube video at <url>
@Deus remind me every Monday morning what I worked on last week
```

> **Switching from another AI?** Paste this into your current AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and send the output to Deus in your first conversation:
>
> ```
> I'm switching to a new AI assistant called Deus. Generate a structured summary
> about me that I can give it so it knows me from day one. Include:
>
> 1. About me - name, role, location, languages
> 2. What I use AI for - main topics and tasks
> 3. Communication style - how I like responses
> 4. Preferences - things I've corrected you on
> 5. Key context - ongoing projects, goals, background
>
> Be specific and factual. Skip anything generic. Format as plain text.
> ```

## CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `deus` | Launch in the current directory (project mode if outside `~/deus`) |
| `deus home` | Launch in home mode regardless of current directory |
| `deus codex` | Use OpenAI/Codex backend for this session |
| `deus auth` | Rebuild and restart background services |
| `deus gcal` | Google Calendar token management (`status`, `auth`, `ping`) |
| `deus listen` | Record from mic, transcribe locally, copy to clipboard |

For direct Codex CLI sessions outside the `deus` launcher, register Deus memory
recall as an MCP tool through the repo launcher:

```bash
codex mcp add deus-memory -- /path/to/deus/scripts/deus-memory-mcp
```

## Comparison

|  | **Deus** | **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** | **[NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw)** | **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** | **Plain Claude** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | Remembers past conversations and learns preferences | Markdown files | Via OpenClaw | Full-text search + preference profiling | Conversation only |
| **Learning** | Scores itself, fixes mistakes, improves over time | No | No | Auto-creates & refines skills | No |
| **Channels** | 5 (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Gmail) | 10+ | Via OpenClaw | 15+ (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Matrix...) | None |
| **Isolation** | Container per conversation | Opt-in Docker | Landlock + seccomp | Per-session | None |
| **LLM support** | Claude default, OpenAI opt-in | Any provider | Any (via OpenClaw) | Any (10+ providers) | Claude only |
| **Setup** | ~5 min | ~15 min | ~20 min | ~10 min | N/A |
| **Repo size** | ~13 MB | ~592 MB | ~22 MB | ~147 MB | N/A |

Deus goes deep on memory, learning, and security. Hermes goes wide on channels and LLM flexibility. See [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md) for detailed numbers.
